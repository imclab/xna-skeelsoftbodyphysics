Skeel Soft Body Physics Tutorial
============================

This repository contains the source codes and pdf for my Introduction to Soft Body Physics tutorial.

In the tutorial, you will learn how to program your own soft body simulations in real-time environments. Here are some of the things that you will be able to create by the end of the tutorial:

This tutorial has been honoured with three prizes:

+ Best Physics Knowledge Base Entry, Intel Havok Physics Contest (March 2009)
+ Community Voting Prize, Intel Havok Physics Contest (January 2009)
+ First Prize, Ziggyware Fall 2008 XNA Article Contest (December 2008)

It assumes that you are an absolute beginner in physics simulation programming, but it does assume that you know about object-oriented programming. The tutorial uses XNA 3.0, which is the framework used for creating games on the PC, Xbox 360 and the Zune (Microsoft’s MP3 player). The language used is C#.

Hope you like the tutorial!
